# Swing Trading Plan

**Objective:** Capture medium-term price swings (holding positions for several days to weeks) using primarily H4 and D1 timeframes.

**Core Strategy:** Enter trades based on Reversal signals from the main trend or significant Breakouts from price ranges on the H4 or D1 timeframe.

---

## Entry Conditions

### 1. Reversal Signal

1.  **Identify Main Trend:** Determine the prevailing trend on the D1/H4 timeframe.
2.  **Identify Potential Reversal Zone:** Wait for the price to approach a significant support/resistance zone identified using Fibonacci Retracement levels (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%).
3.  **Stochastic Confirmation:** Look for Overbought (>80 for potential short reversal) or Oversold (<20 for potential long reversal) conditions on the Stochastic Oscillator, aligning with the anticipated reversal direction.
4.  **MACD Confirmation:** Seek confirmation from MACD signals supporting the reversal:
    *   Divergence (Price makes a new high/low, but MACD doesn't).
    *   MACD line crossing above/below the Signal Line in the direction of the expected reversal.
5.  **Price Action Confirmation:** Final confirmation requires clear Price Action signals at the support/resistance zone:
    *   Reversal candlestick patterns (e.g., Pin Bar, Engulfing, Hammer, Shooting Star).
    *   Formation suggesting a trend change (e.g., failure to make a new high/low).

### 2. Breakout Signal

1.  **Identify Range:** Clearly define a price consolidation range on the H4/D1 timeframe.
2.  **Wait for Breakout:** Wait for a decisive price break above the range resistance (for long) or below the range support (for short).
3.  **MACD Confirmation:** Confirm the breakout with increasing momentum shown by MACD:
    *   Histogram bars growing taller in the direction of the breakout.
    *   MACD line crossing the Signal Line in the direction of the breakout.
4.  **(Optional) Volume Confirmation:** Observe if trading volume increases significantly during the breakout, adding further confirmation.
5.  **(Optional) Retest Entry:** For a more conservative entry, wait for the price to pull back and retest the broken level (resistance becomes support, or support becomes resistance) before entering.

## Tool Application

*   **Fibonacci Retracement:**
    *   Identify potential support/resistance levels for Reversal entries.
    *   Determine potential Take Profit targets (using extensions or key retracement levels).
    *   Assist in placing Stop Loss orders below/above key levels.
*   **Stochastic Oscillator:**
    *   Identify Overbought (>80) and Oversold (<20) conditions to filter entry signals, especially for Reversal trades. Avoid buying in overbought and selling in oversold unless other strong confirmations exist.
*   **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**
    *   Confirm trend momentum.
    *   Identify Divergence as an early warning for potential Reversals.
    *   Use Crossovers (MACD line vs. Signal line) to confirm entry direction after Breakouts or Reversals.
*   **Price Action:**
    *   The ultimate confirmation tool before entering a trade.
    *   Analyze candlestick patterns (Pin Bars, Engulfing, Doji, etc.) at key levels.
    *   Observe chart patterns (Head & Shoulders, Triangles, Flags, etc.).
    *   Confirm breaks of trendlines or support/resistance levels.

## Risk Management

*   **Stop Loss (SL):**
    *   **Mandatory for every trade.**
    *   Place logically:
        *   Below recent swing low / above recent swing high.
        *   Below/above the key support/resistance level or Fibonacci level the entry was based on.
        *   Adjust based on volatility (e.g., using ATR).
*   **Take Profit (TP):**
    *   Set at least one TP target.
    *   Base targets on:
        *   Next significant support/resistance level.
        *   Fibonacci Extension levels.
        *   A predefined Risk/Reward Ratio (R:R), aiming for at least 1:1.5 or 1:2.
    *   Consider Partial Take Profit: Close a portion of the position at the first target and potentially trail the stop loss for the remainder.
*   **Position Sizing:**
    *   Calculate trade size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.
    *   **Risk no more than 1-2% of total account equity on any single trade.**
    *   Formula: `Position Size = (Account Equity * Risk Percentage) / (Stop Loss Distance in Pips * Pip Value)`

## Trade Management Flow (Conceptual)

1.  **Market Analysis (D1/H4):** Identify Trend / Range. Mark Key S/R Levels & Fibonacci zones.
2.  **Opportunity Scan:** Look for price approaching key levels (Reversal) or consolidating (Breakout).
3.  **Signal Watch:** Monitor Stochastic, MACD, and Price Action for entry conditions.
    *   **Reversal:** Fib level hit? Stochastic OB/OS? MACD Divergence/Cross? Price Action Pattern? -> **Confirm**
    *   **Breakout:** Clear Break? MACD Momentum? Volume (Optional)? -> **Confirm** (Wait for Retest? Optional)
4.  **Entry:** If all conditions met, calculate Position Size based on SL placement and 1-2% risk rule. Place Entry Order.
5.  **Set Orders:** Immediately place Stop Loss and Take Profit orders.
6.  **Monitor:** Review open trades periodically (e.g., end of H4/D1 candle).
7.  **Adjust (If Applicable):** Consider trailing stop loss if the trade moves significantly in profit. Consider closing early if the market context changes drastically against the trade.
8.  **Exit:** Trade hits TP or SL.
9.  **Review:** Log the trade details and outcome. Analyze what worked/didn't work.
